# Hoggard: Static Site Generator
A very, very, very simple static site generator. 

This name of this repo is inspired by the batting of [Matthew Hoggard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hoggard)

> Hoggard also had a sound defensive batting technique, but was not known for scoring runs, averaging only 7.40 with the bat. He could block up an end for the batsman at the other end to score, and was also used as a nightwatchman.
